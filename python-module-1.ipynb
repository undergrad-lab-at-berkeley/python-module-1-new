    "*From the Jupyter documentation:* \"First and foremost, the Jupyter Notebook is **an interactive environment for writing and running code**. The notebook is capable of running code in a wide range of languages. However, each notebook is associated with a single kernel. This notebook is associated with the IPython kernel, therefore runs Python code.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jupyter vs. the Command Line\n",
    "Python is also commonly run on the command line (to test this out: open the terminal on your operating system and type `python3` to launch the  Python interactive mode). We prefer to use Jupyter Notebook (at least for now!) because of its friendlier interface and the ability to have plain text, LaTeX, images, and even videos on the same screen as your code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, unlike a Python script, which is a continuous \"block\" of code, Jupyter Notebooks are split up into **cells** of code that can be run independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Cells?\n",
    "Cells are the modular pieces that make up a Jupyter Notebook. Cells primarily come in two types (although there are more): **Code** and **Markdown**. The cell that you are currently looking at is a Markdown cell: it displays plain text. A code cell, as the name suggests, contains code that can be executed. You've seen two of them at the top of the page; they executed commands to set up this Python Module.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to interact with cells:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Command Mode:** Press `Esc`, notice the cell outline will turn blue.  <br>\n",
    "**Edit Mode:** Press `Enter`, or double-click on a cell. Notice it will now have a green outline. As the name suggests, this is the mode to be in if you want to edit the contents of individual cells.<br>\n",
    "<br>**Common Shortcuts**<br>\n",
    "* `Ctrl-Enter`: Run current cell\n",
    "* `Shift-Enter`: Run current cell, and select cell below\n",
    "* `H`: Show all keyboard shortcuts\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a lot of great guides in the Help tab above!<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the kernel?\n",
    "Another term that pops up often is the kernel. The IPython kernel is the \"computational engine\" that executes the code contained in a Notebook document. You can think of it as the active process that is processing all of the Notebook's activity. (Note the IPython kernel is very different from the kernel in systems programming)."

All languages have variables but variable in Python are <i>dynamically-typed</i> (unlike other statically-typed languages like Java).
